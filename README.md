# Instructions

Today's assignment consists of 3 ruby exercises. Each exercise has its own
directory:

- 06caesar
- 07grades
- 08contacts

Inside each directory are 3 files: `exercise_name.rb`, `exercise_name_test.rb`
and `instructions.md`.

Following the instructions, you need to modify the file `exercise_name.rb` so
the tests will pass.
